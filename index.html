                            Vim traces its ancestry back to Ed, a text editor originally created in 1971.
                            Ed was designed for teletype machines.

                            Ed was considered user unfriendly (for a vim family editor) and was replaced in 1978 by an editor called EXtended, which was an extension of the functionality provided by Ed (this naming scheme is a bad habit among VIM editors)

                            Ex is important as many of the most powerful VIM commands derive from it. Ex was also important as it started to take advantage of video terminals.

                            VI stands for visual interface to Ex. VI was designed to be a screen oriented version of Ex.

                            Finally in 1991 we arrive at VIM, VI Improved.

                            VIM was made to clean up VI and add useful features such as a scripting language and macros.

                            VIM still sees active development today with the last major version, VIM 8, being released late 2016.

                            VIM is a way of interacting with text, more than it is a specific editor. As a result most modern editors and IDEs have a VIM plugin (even EMACs, after all they needed a text editor :P)

                            VIM can be set into several different modes, in each mode it behaves differently

                            For instance in insert mode pressing i results in i being entered into the buffer, in normal (command) mode pressing i changes to insert mode

                            For example 3j moves down 3 lines instead of the 1 line that j moves down, or 3w move forward 3 words.
